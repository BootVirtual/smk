**S**chul**m**anagement und -**k**ommunikation

Platform dedicated to school management and communications.

Please note that this is still a work-in-progrss and is currently far from production-ready.

## Motivation

My school is insanely unorganised and divided in 100s of WhatsApp groups. This platform aims to centralise communications and common management tasks in schools.

## Features (or rather roadmap)

Currently following things are planned (this may or may not change in the future):

- Access levels (student, parent, teacher, principal, etc. but also class/grade based)
- Announcements/Communications visible only for specific groups/classes/people
- Calendar (school events)
- Library catalogue

## Endnote

This project is being developed as a submission to [HackClub](https://hackclub.com/). It is still very much a WIP, this page will get updated whenever necessary but will remain pretty barren for the time being.
